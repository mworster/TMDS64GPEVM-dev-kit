# TMDS64GPEVM-dev-kit

Startup, notes, and files for playing with the Texas Instruments Dual-Core 64bit AM6442 Evaluation Module (EVM)

TI website: https://www.ti.com/tool/TMDS64GPEVM

The processor software development kit (SDK) for the Sitara AM64X processors: https://www.ti.com/tool/PROCESSOR-SDK-AM64X
Uses the Code Composer Studio (CCS) Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
Allows for Linux only devlopment for free, requires an account for RTOS or baremetal work. 

The non-Linux only SDK requires advanced approval, this takes 1-2 Business Days and needs you to afirm you're not a milatary contractor. 
For me it only took 1 day to access the SDK and documents.

The documents include:
* Manifest File.html
* md5sum.txt
* processor_sdk_sitara_am64x_07_02_00_02_docs.tar.xz
* processor_sdk_sitara_am64x_07_02_00_02-linux-x64-installer.run
* processor_sdk_sitara_am64x_07_02_00_02-windows-x64-installer.exe
* software_manifest.html
* TI Migration to FreeRTOS Overview.pdf
* TwinCAT_Project3.zip
